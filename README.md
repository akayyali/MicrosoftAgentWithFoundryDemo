# MicrosoftAgentWithFoundryDemo
## This is a Demo that showcases how to consume an Azure AI Foundry Agent using Microsoft Agent Framework.

When to use this pattern:
- You want to reuse a prebuilt or centrally managed agent (e.g., a “Sales Insights Agent”) across multiple channels.

- You need enterprise‑grade control over:
  - Authentication, authorization, and tenancy
  - Data access and compliance
  - Observability and cost management

- You want to iterate on agent behavior (prompts, tools, models) in Foundry without redeploying the app.

To run this code make sure to set config value for "FoundryProjectEndpoint" properly, and set AgentDemoController.agentName parameter value.
